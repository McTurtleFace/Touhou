This is my major project two for grade 12 computer science with Mr. Zhang.

The game is implemented to a basic level. In Linux the rendering works pretty well. In Windows it is a different story. Somehow the switch statements broke everything on the Windows implementation :D. Windows also scales the window badly meaning that unless your screen is perfectly 1080x1920 the window will be a pain in the butt.

The engine documentation is all found at https://mcturtleface.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Veryreal/pages/491637/The+Basics where it should be publicly accessible. A lot of my time tonight was spent with the Oiler's game in the background trying to get windows to work and as such the documentation is not written as well as I would like if I had to use the engine.

In order to play the game go into the build folder on this page and take the correct folder for your OS.
